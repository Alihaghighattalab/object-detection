**What is Object Detection?**
Imagine a world where computers can "see" like humans, identifying and pinpointing objects in images and videos. Object detection, a core branch of artificial intelligence, makes this vision a reality.
By analyzing visual data, object detection algorithms can accurately locate and classify objects, even amidst variations in size, shape, color, and background complexity. This technology finds applications in various domains, including:
- Robotics: Guiding robots to navigate environments safely and interact with objects.
- Video Surveillance: Automating anomaly detection and security monitoring.
- Medical Diagnosis: Assisting medical professionals in identifying abnormalities in medical scans.
- Self-Driving Cars: Enabling autonomous vehicles to perceive and react to their surroundings.
